In order to setup a new machine run:

```
make install
```

Running this command will:

  - Install packages and formulas (from `brew`, `gem`, `pip`, `npm`).
  - Install a minimal `vim`configuration and a more advanced configuration for `nvim`.
  - Set sensible OSX defaults (see `macos/set-defaults.sh`).
  - Link all the dotfiles to their expected location in `~`.
