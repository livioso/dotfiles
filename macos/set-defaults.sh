# Or, in other words, set shit how I like in macOS.

# The original idea (and a couple settings) were grabbed from:
#   https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos
#
# Run ./set-defaults.sh and you'll be good to go.

# Set highlight color to green
defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleHighlightColor -string "0.764700 0.976500 0.568600"

# Always open everything in Finder's list view. This is important.
defaults write com.apple.Finder FXPreferredViewStyle Nlsv

# Show the ~/Library folder.
chflags nohidden ~/Library

# Set a really fast key repeat.
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1

# Set the Finder prefs for showing a few different volumes on the Desktop.
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowExternalHardDrivesOnDesktop -bool false 
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowRemovableMediaOnDesktop -bool false
